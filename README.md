# ðŸ«¡ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael MontaÃ±a

- âœŠ Iâ€™m interested in software development, particularly Python, Django, and building REST APIs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django Rest Framework (DRF), GitLab, and optimization techniques for web applications.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at michaelmontana0822@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems!

#

Iâ€™ve been learning Python by working through open-source tutorials, watching YouTube guides, and solving real problems from client projects.
These resources have not only deepened my understanding of Python but have also given me practical insights into problem solving
and web developement. I'm excited to use what Iâ€™ve learned in future work and keep growing as a developer.
